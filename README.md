This is a project I did for my class - CS 665: Intro to Database Systems.

Our task was to make a application that connects to a relational database and also create a UI that performs predefined SQL and CRUD operations.

This was my first time really using GitHub, PHP, HTML, and Docker so I learned a lot from this project.

Let me know if you have any questions. Also I would love to hear your feedback on how I could improve this project and make it more effective. 

Thanks!
